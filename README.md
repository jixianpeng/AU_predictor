# AU_predictor
AU[1,2,4,6,12,15,20,25]

1. Due to the limition of file_size and the off-line operation in this project, we offer a cloud disk url https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rOgVD-5Lzz5gRqQt0f0t0g, in which the segmented faces, border images and the landmarks stored. Please download, decompress and place them into the corresponding path in this project by the name, while the cropped_aligned frames and the original videos from the original dataset, without any change, are not supplied. 

2. All the pre-processing about the image border extraction and face segmentation have been implemented in the data-seg-store.py

3. With all the pre-calculated data already, AU_Test.py could be used for prediction and the model could be re-trained with Aspect_based_train.py 

4. Same path structure are needed for the ./train/ and ./valid/
