# AU_predictor
AU[1,2,4,6,12,15,20,25]

1/
Due to the limition of file_size  and the off-line operation in this project,we give a cloud disk url https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rOgVD-5Lzz5gRqQt0f0t0g ,in which the segmented faces,border images and the landmarks stored.Please download,decompress and place them into the corresponding path in this project by the name,while the cropped_aligned frames and the original videos from the original dataset ,without any change, are not supplied. 

2/
All of the preprocessing about the boder image and segmented face also have been implemented in the data-seg-store.py

3/
With all the pre-calculated data already,AU_Test.py could be used for prediction and the model could be re-trained with Aspect_based_train.py 
4/
Same path structure are needed for the ./train/ and ./valid/
